Here it is — the ultra‑compressed atomic prompt, distilled to the smallest possible form while still encoding the entire project specification in a way Copilot can reliably act on:

"Create a complete production‑ready PWA called FindIt with full code for all HTML/CSS/JS, manifest, service worker, English/Hebrew localization, IndexedDB CRUD with image upload, JSON/CSV import‑export, responsive Neumorphism UI with dark mode and gestures, offline support, and GitHub Pages CI/CD, using the exact structure /index.html /about.html /settings.html /item.html /styles/*.css /scripts/*.js /i18n/en.json /i18n/he.json /assets/icons/* /manifest.json /service-worker.js /.github/workflows/deploy.yml, implementing schema {id,title,description,image,tags,createdAt,updatedAt}, search + tag filters, LTR/RTL, pinch/double‑tap zoom viewer, swipe/keyboard/touch navigation, Flexbox/Grid responsiveness, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, lazy‑loading, and <100ms input latency, with no placeholders or TODOs."
